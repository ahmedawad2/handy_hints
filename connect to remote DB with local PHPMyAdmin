this will help connecting to a remote Mysql DB using yout locally installed phpMyAdmin.
assuming you have phpMyAdmin installed and working fine on your local server, we only need to change
the phpMyAdmin configuration file that holds servers information.
we actually will add another set of configuration to the file, so we can connect to multiple servers.

the configuration file is located on : /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

you will need to add these set of configuration to the end of the file (most preferable place):

$i++; //incrementing variable for each server. 


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = ''; //server name or IP.


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = ''; //MySql port, default is 3306.


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] = '';//path to socket, leave blank for default.


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type'] = '';//tcp or socket.


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'] = 'mysqli';//php MySql extension to use, mysql or mysqli.


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['compress'] = false;//Use compressed protocol for the MySQL connection (requires PHP >= 4.3.0)


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'cookie';//method of authentication, use cookie.


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = '';//username


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '';//password.

For more info on the config options, please visit the official documentation provided by phpMyAdmin.

========================

Many hosting companies do not allow remote database access by default, so first check with your hosting company and enable this feature. some hosting companies, allows to define a list of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the remote database server.

By using this setup to access your remote database, you need to know that it can become a security issue, if your machine is breached, as the credentials are stored in clear text in the config file. This makes your database as secure as your localhost machine.
