to install a .deb file:
1) sudo dpkg -i /path
2) sudo apt install ./name.deb
3) sudo apt install /path
* after this, you must use: sudo apt-get install -f, When dpkg install a package and package dependency is not satisfied, it leaves the package in 
unconfigured state and that package is considered as broken.
sudo apt-get install -f command tries to fix this broken package by installing the missing dependency.
