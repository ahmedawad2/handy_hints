1)change all the directories permissions inside /home/folder to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):
sudo find /home/folder -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
=====================

2)change all the files permissions inside /home/folder to 644 (rw-r--r--):
sudo find /home/folder -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
=====================

3) users in unix based system are: user(u), group(g), and other(o).
you can change and file permissons using chmod command in 2 ways:
1- absolute(numeric) mode -> 0 to 7 digit for each king of users.
e.g: chmod test 764
this gives:
user -> rwx access
group: rw access
other: r access
the weight of digits is:
r -> 4
w -> 2
x -> 1
and - indicates no permission at all.
2- symbolic mode -> makes use of (+, -, =) to manipulate the permissions of a specific user only.
e.g: chmod a=rwx test
this sets all permissons for all(a) users to rwx.
e.g: chmod g+x test
this adds execute permisson of the group(g) users.
a.g: chmod o-r test
and this removes the read permisson from the other(o) users.
=====================

4) you can change the file owner, group of any file using the chown command as follows:
sudo chown <user>:<group> fileName
e.g: chown root:ahmed test
this makes root, the owner of the test file, and the group user of the same file: ahmed.

- if you want to only change the group users, use chgrp command instead, with the same way.
- all groups in the OS are saved into /etc/group
cat /etc/group
- the groups command lists all groups that the current user is a member of.
- to change the default group that you are a member of, use the: newgrp <groupName> command.
this way, any file that you creates will belong to the <groupName> by default.
