assume you have a current git repo that is HTTPS's associated to a local project.
and that you need to use ssh in the process.

1) generate a new ssh key in your directory of choise, name of your choise:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
2) add your ssh public key to your git host account, e.g: github, or gitlab.
3) re-set the URL of your remote repo:
   (1) copy the clone ssh version of your remote repo.
   (2) navigate to your local project, assuming your remote is called origin:
   git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:someuser/somerepo.git
   (3) now you have to add the newly craeted ssh key into your ssh agent( if it's still not working)
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add /path/to/private/sshKey
