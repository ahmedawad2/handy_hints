Installing Guest Additions on Ubuntu Guest:
on your guest ubuntu, run:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)

then click Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image.
the CD shall be mounted directly, if not, search how to ount it.
finally, run the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run script to install the Guest Additions( which is supposed to run directly also).
reboot.

after that you can directly share folders from your host OS to your ubuntu guest one.
to be able to fully access the shared files, add your guest OS user to the vboxsf group, then reboot or log off.
