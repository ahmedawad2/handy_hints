use:
1- symfony web-skeleton for a normal web app.
2- symfony skeleton for micro service, API, or a console app.
====
can use php's internal server for development, but symfony recommends using a better server using:
composer require server
then run it using:
bin/console server:run
the bin/console command is like the laravel artisan command.
====
recommended plugins for symfony in phpstorm:
symfony support( which needs to be enable for each project).
php annotations
php toolbox
====
routes normally resided into config/routes.yaml file, it's something like:
index:
    path: /
    controller: App\Controller\DefaultController::homaPage
but you can also use annotations to write routes directly inside the controller, above each action method.
to start using annotations, you have to require it:
composer require annotations
then for e.g to make a route:
/**
 * @Route("/")
 */
and for a wildcard routes, you can use /{something}, e.g:
/**
* @Route("/articles/{slug}")
*/
consider that you can match the following with routes:
regex
HTTP methods
host names
====
symfony flex:
is a composer plugin that can do 2 things:
1- aliasing a package, e.g:
composer require sec-checker
this actually requires sensiolabs/security-checker package, but with an alias name, which flex can resolve.
you'll notice a changes to the file: "symfony.lock", this file is managed by flex, keeping track of all recipes that have been installed.
2- manage and run recipes.
recipes can add configuration files, create directories, or even modify some files like .gitignore to straighten the usage of
some package without any further configuring.
for e.g: the recipe included with sec-checker adds some new script to composer.json file,
so that whenever you install a new package, it will run this script to check for package vulnerabilities.
flex can also remove recipes when you un install some package.
